# DataAnalysis
Basic data mining, machine learning algorithms and some useful reference and tool books.


- [Book] Pattern  Recognition and Machine Learning, Bishop

  Some answers to the exercises in the book PRML(Bishop) can be found on http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/PRML/pdf/prml-web-sol-2009-09-08.pdf

- [Tool Book] The Matrix Cookbook

  Gives out some basic matrix/vector derivative formula.

- EM [Top10 Algorithm of Machine Learning]

  Expectation Maximization, a reference link:http://blog.csdn.net/zouxy09/article/details/8537620, an application is GMM

- DES [Encryption Algorithm]

  Data Encryption	Standard, used as the most popular Symmetrical Encryption Algorithm.

- RSA [Encryption Algorithm]

  Developed by three mathematicians: Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, used as the most popular Asymmetrical Encryption Algorithm.
